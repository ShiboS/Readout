### Analysis
Analyse measured data from VNA or IQ mixer with fitting.

### Calculate
Do calculation of CPW and KID from MB theory to all parameters. (under construction)

### Measure
Use PyVISA and GPIB cable to control VNA and LS350/370 temperature controller.
Measure data for several readout power dependance (VNA power -55dBm - 10 dBm) and several temperature dependence (0.1K - 3K)
